Mountaineering, otherwise known as mountain climbing, is a very popular outdoor sport. There are thousands of mountains in the world, all with their own unique terrain, their own challenges and excitements. 

Origins of Mountaineering
Mountaineering has been a common practice if not exactly a hobby for as long as time. People have been scaling mountains for as a hobby since as early as 1336. Sir Alfred Willsâ€™ ascent of the Swiss Wetterhorn in 1865 is considered to be the birth of mountaineering as a sport.
